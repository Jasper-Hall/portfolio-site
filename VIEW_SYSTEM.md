# Portfolio View System

This document describes the 3-way view toggle system implemented in the portfolio site.

## Overview

The portfolio site now features a 3-way toggle switch in the center of the navigation bar that allows users to switch between different viewing modes:

1. **Mind Map View** (Left) - Full-screen mind map with node forest visualization
2. **Split View** (Center) - Current split screen layout with mind map and archive viewer
3. **Gallery View** (Right) - Full-screen scrollable gallery of all projects

## Components

### ViewToggle
- Located in the center of the navigation bar
- 3-button slideable toggle with icons: üß† (Mind Map), ‚ö° (Split View), üñºÔ∏è (Gallery)
- Sliding indicator that moves between positions
- Supports both click and drag interactions
- Touch-friendly for mobile devices
- Smooth transitions between states

### MindMapView
- Full-screen view for the mind map
- Placeholder for p5.js integration (coming soon)
- Shows project categories structure
- Background gradient styling

### SplitView
